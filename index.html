 <h2>Akera Foster</h2>
 <p> I am currently pursuing a major in computer science.
     I am not sure whcih specific area in the field that I want to branch off to.
     As time passes, I will figure it out.
     I became interested in web development when I created my first WIX website for a class in high school.
     Throughout my research, I realized that I enjoyed creating little webpages and designing.
     I got familiar with some of the tools and applications that grew my interest for web development and skills I could learn in this course.
